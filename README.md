### What is Allergy Alert?

Allergy Alert is an Android application that allows users to avoid certain foods that they may be allergic to. When one is wondering whether a food item contains ingredients that they may be allergic to, they can scan or search that food item with our app to check for any warnings.

### How to use?

To use Allergy Alert, one creates an account through their email. Once created, one can add people to their profile and list their allergens. Once added, the user can then search for a food item name, or scan the bar code of a food item. If information about that food item is contained within the database, the app will tell the user whether or not they should be aware of any ingredients in that food item that they may be allergic to.
